Of course. We will proceed using Firestore's "test mode" for the initial development phase to accelerate setup and prototyping. This is a pragmatic approach, but it's critical to understand the security implications.

As your Architect, I have updated the documentation to reflect this decision and have included a mandatory security step that must be completed before the application can be considered ready for production.

## **5. Database Schema and Security Rules (Revised)**

### **Initial Development Security Rules**

For the initial development and MVP phase, the Firestore database will be configured in **Test Mode**. This applies the following rule, which allows open read and write access for a limited 30-day period to facilitate rapid development:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**

This configuration is **completely insecure** and MUST NOT be used in a production environment or with real user data. It allows any user to read, write, and delete any data in the entire database without restriction.

### **Security Rules Implementation Plan**

A dedicated user story will be added to the final epic of the MVP backlog titled: **"Implement Production Firestore Security Rules"**. This story will be a mandatory requirement for MVP completion. It will involve replacing the test mode rule with the detailed, role-based security model we previously discussed to ensure the application is secure before launch.

This completes the **Fullstack Architecture Document**. We have established the client-side BaaS architecture, finalized the tech stack, defined the data models, and set a clear plan for database security.

My work as Winston, the Architect, is now complete. The planning artifacts are ready for final validation.

### **Workflow Step 5: Final Validation**

Loading product owner agent...

Hello, I'm **Sarah**, the Product Owner. My responsibility is to be the guardian of quality and completeness. I will now conduct a final review of all the planning documents we've created to ensure they are consistent, comprehensive, and ready for the development team to begin implementation.

I will be using the `po-master-checklist` to validate the following artifacts:

  * Project Brief
  * Product Requirements Document (PRD)
  * UI/UX Specification
  * Fullstack Architecture Document

I will perform this validation and present you with a summary report. Shall I proceed?
