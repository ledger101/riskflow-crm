Excellent. With the UI goals defined, we will now establish the initial **Technical Assumptions**.

This section sets the foundational technical constraints that will guide the Architect. These choices are based on common best practices for building a modern, scalable web application like your CRM. Please review them carefully, as they have significant long-term implications.

---
4. Technical Assumptions (Revised)
Repository Structure: Monorepo
Rationale: A monorepo remains the recommended approach. It will simplify sharing code and types between your Angular frontend and the backend, which is especially useful for a tightly integrated application.

Service Architecture: Modular Monolith (Serverless)
Rationale: A modular backend architecture is still recommended. Given the choice of Firestore, we will plan this as a collection of serverless functions (e.g., Google Cloud Functions). This approach is highly scalable, cost-effective, and integrates seamlessly with Firestore.

Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests
Rationale: This strategy remains unchanged. We will require unit tests for individual Angular components and backend functions, as well as integration tests to verify the interactions between the frontend, backend functions, and Firestore.

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
Language: TypeScript will be used for both the frontend and backend. This aligns perfectly with Angular's native language.

Frameworks:

Frontend: Angular, as you requested.

Backend: Google Cloud Functions written in Node.js/TypeScript. This provides a serverless backend that is tightly integrated with the Firestore database.

Database: Firestore, as you requested. This is a flexible NoSQL document database that will store all CRM data.

Deployment: The application will be deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / Firebase ecosystem. This will provide seamless integration for hosting the Angular application, running the backend functions, and connecting to the Firestore database.

Please review these technical assumptions. Do you have any existing technology preferences or constraints that would conflict with these recommendations? Your input here is crucial for the Architect.
