# Project Brief: Riskflow CRM Web App

### **Executive Summary**
[cite_start]This project will create a centralized CRM and sales pipeline web application for Riskflow's Emerging Markets team in Africa[cite: 1, 31]. [cite_start]The primary goal is to replace the current multi-sheet Excel-based system with an efficient, modern web app[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This new platform will enable real-time data updates, dynamic pipeline management, and detailed communication tracking for every client engagement, providing a single source of truth for the entire sales process[cite: 31, 32].

### **Problem Statement**
[cite_start]The Emerging Markets team currently relies on a complex Excel document to manage all client and sales data[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This manual system makes real-time collaboration difficult and leads to incomplete data; for example, relationship details and action plans are sparsely filled, which could hinder deal conversion[cite: 16, 26]. [cite_start]The current process lacks a dedicated system for tracking communications, a key requirement for the new app[cite: 30]. [cite_start]With a majority of opportunities in early pipeline stages and ambitious financial targets for FY26, a more robust and efficient system is required to support the necessary sales focus and pipeline nurturing[cite: 23, 27].

### **Proposed Solution**
[cite_start]The proposed solution is a custom-built web application that will centralize all data related to sales opportunities, pipeline stages, client communications, and reporting[cite: 31]. [cite_start]Its key differentiator from the current Excel process will be the integration of detailed, per-stage communication tracking (capturing emails, calls, WhatsApp messages, and meetings)[cite: 30, 43]. [cite_start]The application will feature secure user and role management, configurable master data (solutions, clients, pipeline stages), and real-time reporting dashboards[cite: 33, 35, 37, 48]. This will provide a scalable and efficient platform to manage the entire sales lifecycle.

### **Target Users**
* [cite_start]**Sales Team (Primary)**: Opportunity owners (e.g., Phoebe, Daan, Andre) who will use the system daily to create/update leads, manage their pipeline, log communications, and track actions[cite: 12, 34].
* [cite_start]**Admin / Line of Business Leader (Secondary)**: Users like Phoebe Chapman who require full administrative access to configure the system (pipeline stages, products), manage user roles, and view comprehensive performance reports[cite: 7, 34].
* [cite_start]**Read-Only Stakeholders (Tertiary)**: Other internal leadership or external stakeholders who need access to view reports and dashboards without editing capabilities[cite: 34].

### **Goals & Success Metrics**
* **Business Objectives**:
    * [cite_start]Support the achievement of FY25 financial targets, including $2 million in annual sales and $1 million in annual revenue[cite: 18].
    * [cite_start]Provide the necessary tooling to facilitate the ambitious sales growth expected from the "Calibre Treasury Platform" in FY26[cite: 19, 27].
* **User Success Metrics**:
    * Increase the conversion rate of opportunities from early pipeline stages.
    * [cite_start]Improve the data completeness for stakeholder mapping and communication logs[cite: 26].
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
    * [cite_start]Quarterly Sales vs. Target ($250,000)[cite: 18].
    * [cite_start]Pipeline velocity (time spent in each stage)[cite: 51].
    * [cite_start]Deal conversion rates by stage[cite: 48].
    * [cite_start]Communication volume and frequency per opportunity[cite: 49].

### **MVP Scope**
* **Core Features (Must Have)**:
    * [cite_start]**Setup/Configuration**: Full user and role management[cite: 33]; [cite_start]Management of master data (Solutions, Clients, Stakeholders)[cite: 35, 36]; [cite_start]Configuration of pipeline stages and probabilities[cite: 37].
    * [cite_start]**Execution**: Creation, listing, and editing of sales opportunities[cite: 40]; [cite_start]Management of client stakeholders[cite: 42]; [cite_start]Manual logging of all communication types with notes and attachments[cite: 43]; [cite_start]Assignment and tracking of action items[cite: 45]; [cite_start]Document storage at the opportunity level[cite: 47].
    * [cite_start]**Reporting**: A real-time dashboard showing the overall pipeline by stage/value and performance against financial KPIs[cite: 48, 50]. [cite_start]Basic data export to PDF or Excel[cite: 53].
* **Out of Scope for MVP**:
    * [cite_start]Automated communication logging via API integrations (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp for Business)[cite: 39, 43].
    * [cite_start]A dedicated mobile application[cite: 60].
    * [cite_start]AI-driven insights like deal scoring or sentiment analysis[cite: 61].

### **Technical Considerations**
* [cite_start]**Platform**: The solution will be a web application[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Security**: The system must feature secure user login (email/password, with options for SSO) [cite: 33][cite_start], role-based access controls [cite: 34][cite_start], and encryption for data both in transit and at rest[cite: 54].
* [cite_start]**Compliance**: The system must be designed to be compliant with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR/POPIA[cite: 55].

### **Risks & Open Questions**
* [cite_start]**Risk**: The business is heavily reliant on the "Calibre Treasury Platform" for revenue growth[cite: 25]. The CRM must effectively support the sales cycle for this specific, high-value solution.
* **Risk**: Data migration and cleanup from the source Excel file could be complex.
* [cite_start]**Open Question**: What is the technical feasibility and cost of integrating with major email and messaging platforms for automated logging in a future phase? [cite: 60]

### **Next Steps**
1.  Finalize and approve this Project Brief.
2.  Handoff to the Product Manager (PM) to begin drafting the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD), translating the features outlined here into Epics and User Stories.
