# Story 2.4: Log a Communication

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Sales Team member,
**I want** to log a communication event (e.g., email, call, meeting) against a specific opportunity,
**so that** a complete and chronological record of all client interactions is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The opportunity detail page contains a communication timeline/log section.
2. A form allows the user to add a new communication entry, selecting the type (Email, Call, etc.), date/time, and adding rich text notes.
3. The user can optionally upload one or more file attachments (e.g., meeting recordings, presentations) to a communication log.
4. Once saved, the new entry appears in the communication timeline, sorted chronologically.

## Dev Notes
- Previous Story Insights: OpportunityDetailComponent already created in Story 2.3
- Data Models: Created `Communication` interface with attachment support
  [Source: Implementation]
- Service Layer: Created `CommunicationService` for Firestore CRUD operations
- UI: Integrated communication form and timeline into opportunity detail view
- Firestore: Communications stored with opportunityId reference for querying
- File Uploads: Basic structure in place, full Firebase Storage integration can be added later

## Testing
- Test file location: `src/app/core/services/communication.service.spec.ts`
- Framework: Jasmine with Angular TestBed
