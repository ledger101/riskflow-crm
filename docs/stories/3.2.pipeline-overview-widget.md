# Story 3.2: Pipeline Overview Widget

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Sales Leader,
**I want** a pipeline overview widget on the dashboard that shows the number and total value of opportunities in each stage,
**so that** I can quickly assess the health of the sales funnel.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ A widget on the dashboard visually represents the sales pipeline (e.g., as a funnel or bar chart).
2. ✅ Each stage in the chart displays the total count of opportunities and the sum of their financial value.
3. ✅ The data in the widget updates in real-time as opportunities are created or their stages are changed.
4. ✅ Clicking on a stage in the widget can (optionally, as a nice-to-have) navigate the user to the Opportunities list, pre-filtered for that stage.
