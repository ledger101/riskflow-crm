# Story 3.4: Data Export Functionality

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** Sales Leader,
**I want** to export the opportunity list as an Excel or PDF file,
**so that** I can perform offline analysis or share reports with stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An "Export" button is available on the "Opportunities" page.
2. Clicking the button gives the user the option to export as either Excel or PDF.
3. The exported file includes all relevant opportunity data (client, value, stage, probability, etc.).
4. The export respects any active filters (stage, search, etc.) applied to the opportunities list.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Add export button to opportunities list header
  - [ ] Implement export dropdown menu with format options
  - [ ] Add proper styling and icons

  - [ ] Integrate PDF export library (e.g., jsPDF, pdfmake)
  - [ ] Implement format selection dialog

- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Map opportunity data to export format

  - [ ] Add headers and metadata to exports

- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4)
