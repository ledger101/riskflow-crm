# Story 1.4: Solution Master Data Management (Admin)

## Story Details
- **Story ID**: 1.4
- **Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Configuration
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As an** Admin,
**I want** to create, view, edit, and manage the list of company solutions/products,
**so that** sales reps can accurately assign them to new opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An admin-only page for managing solutions is created and is inaccessible to non-admin roles.
2. Admins can add a new solution, providing a name and description.
3. Admins can edit the name and description of an existing solution.
4. All available solutions are displayed in a list.
5. A solution cannot be deleted if it is associated with an existing opportunity (future-proofing).

## Technical Requirements
Based on the architecture and previous stories:

### Frontend Implementation
- Create `SolutionManagementModule` (lazy-loaded) with `SolutionListComponent` and `SolutionFormComponent`.
- Configure route `/admin/solutions` protected by `AdminGuard`.
- Use existing `SolutionService` from `core/services/solution.service.ts` for CRUD operations.
- Display a data table of solutions with name and description; provide "Create Solution" and "Edit" actions.
- Implement delete protection by checking if solution is associated with existing opportunities.

### Firebase Setup
- Use Firestore collection `solutions` to store solution data.
- Implement proper security rules to allow only admin users to read/write solution data.
- Add validation to prevent deletion of solutions that have associated opportunities.

### Dependencies
_No additional dependencies beyond existing Firebase and AngularFire packages._

## Definition of Done
- [x] Admin-only solution management page implemented and accessible at `/admin/solutions`.
- [x] Solution creation with name and description works correctly.
- [x] Solution editing updates data and reflects immediately in UI.
- [x] Solutions list displays all available solutions with proper formatting.
- [x] Delete protection prevents removal of solutions associated with opportunities.
- [x] Non-admin users cannot access solution management functionality.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests cover solution CRUD operations and access control.
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to `main` branch.

## Development Notes
- Leverage existing `SolutionService` if already implemented
- Follow same patterns established in User Management (Story 1.3)
- Ensure consistent UI/UX with other admin interfaces
- Add proper error handling and user feedback

## Ready for Development
This story is ready for the Dev agent to begin implementation.
