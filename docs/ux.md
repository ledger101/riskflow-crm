Greetings! I'm **Sally**, your UX Expert. It's a pleasure to join the project. My focus is entirely on the userâ€”ensuring that the CRM we design is not just functional, but also intuitive, efficient, and a pleasure to use for the sales team.

[cite_start]I have received the approved Product Requirements Document (PRD) from John, and I've reviewed the detailed functional specification in your original `crm.txt` file [cite: 28-61]. My task is to create the **UI/UX Specification**, which will serve as the blueprint for the application's design and user flow.

We will build this document section by section using the `front-end-spec-tmpl.yaml` template. Let's start by establishing the foundational goals and principles that will guide all of our design decisions.

# Riskflow CRM Web App UI/UX Specification

## **1. Introduction**

[cite_start]This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Riskflow CRM Web App[cite: 31]. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

#### **Target User Personas**
Based on the PRD, we are designing for three primary user groups:
* [cite_start]**Sales Team**: The primary users who will be in the system daily, managing their opportunities and logging communications[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Admin / Line of Business Leader**: Users who need to configure the system, manage master data, and view high-level reports[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Read-Only Stakeholders**: Users who require access to view dashboards and reports but cannot edit data[cite: 34].

#### **Usability Goals**
* **Efficiency of Use**: Sales reps should be able to log a communication or update an opportunity's stage with minimal clicks and time.
* **Ease of Learning**: A new team member should be able to navigate the system and perform core tasks (like creating a lead) without requiring extensive training.
* **Error Prevention**: The interface should guide users and use clear validation to minimize incorrect data entry.

#### **Design Principles**
1.  **Clarity Over Cleverness**: The interface must be immediately understandable. The priority is to present data and actions in the clearest way possible.
2.  **Consistency is Key**: The application will use consistent patterns and components for similar actions to create a predictable and reliable user experience.
3.  **Progressive Disclosure**: To avoid overwhelming users, we will show only the most necessary information by default and provide clear paths to access more detailed data when needed.
