With the core user flows mapped out, the next step is to bridge the gap between these abstract processes and a concrete visual layout. This section outlines our approach to **Wireframes and Mockups**.

As an AI, I cannot create visual designs directly. Instead, I will help conceptualize the layouts and document where the official, high-fidelity designs will be created and maintained (typically in a tool like Figma).

## **4. Wireframes & Mockups**

### **Primary Design Files**
All high-fidelity mockups and prototypes for this project will be created and maintained in a professional design tool, such as Figma. This will serve as the single source of truth for the application's visual design.

**Primary Design Files:** `[Link to Figma/Sketch project will be placed here]`

### **Key Screen Layouts**
To guide the design process, here is a conceptual layout for the most critical screen in the application: the **Opportunity Detail View**.

#### **Screen: Opportunity Detail View**
* **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive, "at-a-glance" view of a single sales deal. This screen acts as the central hub for all information, communications, and actions related to that deal.

* **Conceptual Layout**: A two-column layout is proposed to effectively organize the information:
    * **Left Column (Key Information Panel)**: This area will prominently display the most critical deal data for quick reference.
        * **Header**: Opportunity Title
        * **Key Details**: Client, Solution, Value, Current Stage, Probability, Owner.
        * **Action Items**: A list of "to-do" items for the deal, with the ability to add new items and mark existing ones as complete.
    * **Right Column (Main Content Area)**: This area will feature the dynamic, chronological log of all activities.
        * **Primary Feature**: The **Communication Timeline**, showing every logged call, email, and meeting in reverse chronological order.
        * **Primary Actions**: Buttons to "Log Communication" and "Edit Opportunity" will be located at the top of this section for easy access.

* **Interaction Notes**: The communication timeline will be the main scrollable element on the page. Clicking "Edit" or "Log Communication" will open a modal form for data entry.

Does this approach of using a dedicated design tool like Figma and this conceptual layout for the main screen align with your vision for the application?
